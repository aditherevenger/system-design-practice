## **ðŸ“Œ Overview**
This repository is my **personal system design playground** where I practice, explore, and document **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **High-Level Design (HLD)** concepts.  
The goal is to:
- Enhance my problem-solving skills for system design.
- Write clean, maintainable, and testable code.
- Document design choices with diagrams and trade-offs.
- Practice real-world design scenarios inspired by companies like **Swiggy, Uber, Netflix, etc.**

## **ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside?**

### **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
- Focused on **class diagrams, OOP principles, and design patterns**.
- Each project includes:
  - UML diagrams (Class, Sequence).
  - Unit tests and clean code.

### **High-Level Design (HLD)**
- Focused on **system architecture and scalability**.
- Includes:
  - Component diagrams.
  - Trade-offs between design choices.
  - System constraints & scaling techniques.

---

## **ðŸš€ Projects**
### **LLD**
- [Project A - Parking Lot Design](./LLD/project-A/README.md) *(example)*
- [Project B - Book My Show Design](./LLD/project-B/README.md)

### **HLD**
- [Project X - Food Delivery System (Swiggy-like)](./HLD/project-X/README.md)
- [Project Y - Distributed Cache (like Redis)](./HLD/project-Y/README.md)

---

## **ðŸ§ª Testing**
- Every LLD project includes **unit test cases** under the `tests/` folder.
- To run all tests:
  ```bash
  # Example for Go/Java/Python (modify as per language)
  make test

## ðŸ”’ Security
- Integrated GitHub Security Actions (.github/workflows/security.yml) to perform:
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency scanning

## ðŸ“„ License
This repository is  [LICENSE](LICENSE) under the MIT License.

## ðŸ“š Resources
Iâ€™m actively learning from:

- Grokking the System Design Interview
- Low-Level Design blogs and Swiggy ASDE learnings.
