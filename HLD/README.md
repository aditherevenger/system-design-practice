# High-Level Design (HLD)

---

## **📌 Overview**
This folder contains **High-Level Design (HLD)** projects that focus on **scalable system architecture** and **distributed systems**.  
Each project includes:
- **System requirements and functional specs**.
- **Architecture diagrams (component, sequence, data flow)**.
- **Trade-off analysis (e.g., CAP theorem, database choices)**.
- **Scalability, reliability, and fault-tolerance strategies**.

---

## **📂 Structure**
Each HLD project follows this structure:
```bash
HLD/
├── project-name/
│ ├── README.md # Project-specific documentation
│ ├── architecture/ # Diagrams (System, Sequence, Data flow)
│ └── notes.md # Design decisions, trade-offs, Q&A
```

## **📝 List of HLD Projects**
| #   | Project Name                            | Description                                  | Link                                    |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Food Delivery System (Swiggy-like)**  | End-to-end architecture for a delivery app   | [View Project](./project-food-delivery/) |
| 2   | **Distributed Cache (like Redis)**      | Design of an in-memory key-value store       | [View Project](./project-distributed-cache/) |
| 3   | **Video Streaming Platform**            | Scalable platform like YouTube/Netflix       | [View Project](./project-video-streaming/) |
| 4   | **URL Shortener**                       | Design for a URL shortening service          | [View Project](./project-url-shortener/) |

*(Keep updating this table as new HLD projects are added.)*

## **📖 How to Use**
1. Open any project folder (e.g., `project-food-delivery`).
2. Check its `README.md` for:
   - Functional and non-functional requirements.
   - System architecture diagrams.
   - Trade-offs and scalability discussion.
3. View diagrams in the `architecture/` folder.

## **📐 Diagrams**
- Diagrams include:
  - **System Design Diagrams** – Overall architecture and components.
  - **Sequence Diagrams** – Request/response flow.
  - **Data Flow Diagrams** – Storage and data movement.
- Tools used: **Draw.io**, **Lucidchart**, **PlantUML**.

## **📚 Resources**
I learn HLD concepts from:
- **Grokking the System Design Interview**
- **Real-world architectures from Swiggy, Uber, Netflix, etc.**
