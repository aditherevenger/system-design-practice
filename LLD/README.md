# Low-Level Design (LLD)

---

## **📌 Overview**
This folder contains **Low-Level Design (LLD)** problems and their implementations.  
Each project here focuses on:
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** and principles like **SOLID**.
- **UML diagrams** (Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams).
- **Clean, modular, and testable code**.
- **Test cases** to validate the design.

---

## **📂 Structure**
Each project in this folder follows the structure:

```bash
LLD/
├── project-name/
│ ├── README.md # Project-specific documentation
│ ├── src/ # Implementation code
│ ├── tests/ # Unit tests
│ └── diagrams/ # UML/Class diagrams
```

## **📖 How to Use**
1. Navigate to any project folder.
2. Read its `README.md` for:
   - Problem statement
   - Class diagrams
   - Code structure
   - Test instructions
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   # Example (Modify based on language or test framework)
   cd LLD/project-name
   make test
    ```
## **🧪 Testing**
- Every project includes a tests/ directory.
- Test cases validate the correctness of the design and code.

## **🖼 UML Diagrams**
- Each project includes UML diagrams under its diagrams/ folder.
- Diagrams are created using tools like Draw.io, PlantUML, or Lucidchart.

## **📚 Resources**
I practice LLD from:
- Grokking the Object-Oriented Design Interview
- Head First Design Patterns
- Real-world examples from companies like Swiggy, Uber, and Netflix.
